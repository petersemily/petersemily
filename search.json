    "text": "“Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.” — Hadley Wickham\n\nR is a powerful language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used among statisticians and data analysts for data analysis and developing statistical software. Here are some basic concepts and elements of R to help you get started:\n\n\n\nVariables in R are used to store data. You can create a variable using the assignment operator &lt;- (option/Alt + -). For example:\n\n\nCode\nmy_variable &lt;- 10\n\n\nThis will store the value 10 in my_variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nR has several basic data types:\n\nNumeric: For decimal values like 2.5.\nInteger: For whole numbers like 2L (the L tells R it is an integer).\nCharacter: For text or string values, e.g., \"Hello\".\nLogical: For boolean values (TRUE or FALSE).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVectors are a basic data structure in R. They contain elements of the same type. You can create a vector using the c() function:\n\n\nCode\nmy_vector &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData frames are used for storing data tables in R. It is a list of vectors of equal length. For example, to create a simple data frame:\n\n\nCode\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  Name = c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\"), \n  Age = c(25, 30)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions are used to carry out specific tasks in R. For example, sum() is a function that adds numbers together:\n\n\nCode\nsum(1, 2, 3) # Returns 6\n\n\n[1] 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR has a vast collection of packages for various statistical tasks. You can install a package using install.packages(\"packageName\") and load it using library(packageName).\n\n\nCode\n# install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get help on a specific function or topic, use the help() function or the shorthand ?, like ?sum on R Console."

Each point represents a car.\n\n\n2.2.2 Bar Chart\nCreating a bar chart to show the count of cars by the number of cylinders.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl))) + \n  geom_bar() + \n  labs(x = \"Number of Cylinders\", y = \"Count\",\n       title = \"Count of Cars by Cylinders\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plots a bar chart where each bar represents the count of cars with a certain number of cylinders.\n\n\n2.2.3 Line Graph\nPlotting a line graph, assuming we have a time series data.frame economics that is part of ggplot2 package.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = unemploy)) + \n  geom_line() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Number of Unemployed Persons\",\n       title = \"Unemployment over Time\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code plots the unemployment numbers over time, with time on the x-axis and the number of unemployed persons on the y-axis.\n\n\n2.2.4 Faceted Plot\nCreating a faceted plot to compare scatter plots of mpg vs wt across different numbers of cylinders.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~cyl) +\n  labs(title = \"MPG vs Weight by Number of Cylinders\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis splits the data into subsets based on the number of cylinders and creates a scatter plot for each subset."
